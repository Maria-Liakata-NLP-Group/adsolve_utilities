The individual identifies both adaptive and maladaptive self-states within themselves. The maladaptive self-state is described as being characterized by negative emotions, behaviors, and thoughts that hinder the fulfillment of basic psychological needs such as relatedness, autonomy, and competence. This self-state is driven by a central organizing aspect of Affect, which influences the other aspects in a way that leads to negative emotions and behaviors. On the other hand, the adaptive self-state is characterized by positive aspects that support the fulfillment of psychological needs. This self-state is also driven by a central organizing aspect of Affect, but in a way that leads to positive emotions and behaviors. The individual's experience with these self-states highlights the importance of understanding and managing one's mental state in order to lead a fulfilling life.\n"
