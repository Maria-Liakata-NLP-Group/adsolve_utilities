        "summary": "Yesterday, I went to the store and I saw a cat sitting on a tree. I watched the cat for a while, and then a dog came along and chased the cat. The cat ran up another tree to escape the dog. Then a bird flew over the cat. I continued my journed across a field and saw a rabbit hopping across the field. I also saw a cow grazing in the meadow, a horse galloping down the road, and a sheep bleating in the pasture. Finally, I saw a pig sleeping peacefully on a farm. Next to the farm, there was a pond where a fish was swimming. It was a peaceful day in the countryside."
